# 📜 NFT-Based Historical Archives for Government Decisions

Welcome to a revolutionary way to preserve and verify government decisions using blockchain technology! This project creates immutable, tamper-proof archives of historical government decisions as NFTs on the Stacks blockchain. By leveraging NFTs, we ensure transparency, prevent revisionism, and allow public verification of official records, solving real-world issues like data tampering, loss of historical integrity, and lack of trust in governmental archives.

## ✨ Features

📅 Immutable timestamping of decisions for historical accuracy  
🖼️ NFT minting for each decision, linking to verifiable metadata  
🔍 Public search and verification of archived records  
🛡️ Access controls for authorized government entities to submit decisions  
🔄 Amendment tracking without altering original records  
📊 Analytics on decision history and trends  
🌐 Integration with IPFS for off-chain storage of detailed documents  
🚫 Dispute resolution mechanism for challenging records  
✅ Multi-signature approvals for high-stakes decisions  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project uses Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain to handle the archiving process. Government entities can submit decisions, which are minted as NFTs with embedded metadata. The public can then verify and query these archives without intermediaries.

**For Government Entities (Archivers)**  
- Authenticate via the AccessControl contract.  
- Submit decision details (e.g., title, description, hash of the document) to the ArchiveSubmission contract.  
- If required, obtain multi-signature approvals through the MultiSigApproval contract.  
- Mint an NFT via the NFTMinter contract, linking to IPFS-stored files.  
- The Timestamping contract automatically records the immutable creation time.  

Boom! The decision is now archived as an NFT, forever preserved on the blockchain.

**For the Public (Verifiers and Researchers)**  
- Use the ArchiveSearch contract to query decisions by date, keyword, or ID.  
- Call functions in the Verification contract to confirm authenticity and ownership.  
- View amendments via the AmendmentTracker contract if updates exist.  
- Access analytics through the DecisionAnalytics contract for insights like decision frequency or categories.  
- If a dispute arises, initiate a challenge in the DisputeResolution contract.  

That's it! Transparent, verifiable history at your fingertips.

## 📑 Smart Contracts Overview

This project involves 8 Clarity smart contracts to ensure modularity, security, and scalability:  

1. **AccessControl.clar**: Manages roles and permissions for who can submit or approve decisions (e.g., government admins).  
2. **ArchiveSubmission.clar**: Handles the initial submission of decision data, including hashing and basic validation.  
3. **MultiSigApproval.clar**: Enforces multi-signature requirements for sensitive decisions, requiring approvals from multiple parties.  
4. **NFTMinter.clar**: Mints NFTs representing each archived decision, using SIP-009 standards for compatibility.  
5. **Timestamping.clar**: Provides immutable timestamps using Stacks block height and integrates with oracles for real-world time.  
6. **AmendmentTracker.clar**: Tracks any amendments or corrections to decisions, linking back to the original NFT without modification.  
7. **ArchiveSearch.clar**: Enables querying and indexing of archived NFTs by metadata fields like date or category.  
8. **Verification.clar**: Allows anyone to verify the ownership, integrity, and details of an archived decision.  
9. **DecisionAnalytics.clar**: Aggregates data for on-chain analytics, such as counting decisions by type or time period.  
10. **DisputeResolution.clar**: Facilitates community or authority-based disputes over archived content, with voting mechanisms.  

These contracts interact seamlessly: For example, a submission flows from AccessControl → ArchiveSubmission → MultiSigApproval → NFTMinter → Timestamping.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Set up a Stacks development environment with Clarinet.  
2. Deploy the contracts in order (starting with AccessControl for permissions).  
3. Integrate with a frontend (e.g., React) to interact via Hiro Wallet.  
4. Use IPFS for storing full document PDFs linked in NFT metadata.  

This project promotes governmental accountability and historical preservation—perfect for democracies aiming for transparency! If you're building this, start with the NFTMinter and expand from there.
